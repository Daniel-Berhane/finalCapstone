### Usage
This program creates a task manager system that utilises two seperate main menus: one for the admin and another for users.<br>
Features include:
- r - Registering a user (register a new user using valid username and password)
- a - Adding a task (add a new task for any user)
- va - View all tasks (view all tasks on system)
- vm - View my task (view personal tasks)
- gr - Generate reports (generate user-friendly text file  with user task reports)
- ds - Display statistics (report task status to user)
- e - Exit (exit application)

Depending on user privilege some of these features will not appear on the menu.

Files are generated if a user or task file doesn't already exist.


Here are some commonly used Git commands that you can use in the terminal:

- `git status`: Check the status of your local repository.
- `git add <file_name>`: Add changes in a specific file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Push your local commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository.
- `git branch`: List all branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switch to a specific branch.
- `git merge <branch_name>`: Merge a branch into the current branch.
